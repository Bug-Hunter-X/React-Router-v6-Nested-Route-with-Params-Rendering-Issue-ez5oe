This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using nested routes with parameters in React Router v6.  The problem arises when a parent route has a child route with a parameter. Direct navigation to the parent route fails to render the parent component correctly. This example shows the issue and provides a solution.  The `bug.js` file showcases the problematic code, while `bugSolution.js` presents the corrected version.
